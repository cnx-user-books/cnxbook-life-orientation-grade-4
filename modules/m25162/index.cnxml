The sun can help you to feel very healthy and it can help your body to produce important vitamins. People also make use of the sun to dry fruit such as peaches, and vegetables such as tomatoes, and in this way these products can be preserved. Scientists use the rays of the sun to generate power that can be used as a substitute for electricity. We call it solar power.</para>

        <para id="id1168927595805">The sun can also cause damage. When people suntan a lot on the beach in the midday heat - say at 12:00 - the skin becomes so badly damaged that they might develop serious skin problems, such as skin cancer. Also, if you exercise very strenuously in the heat of the sun without drinking water, you would run the risk of dehydrating. Dehydration occurs when the body loses too much moisture, and you feel nauseous and ill. Most plants shrivel up in the hot sun if there isnâ€™t enough water.</para>
